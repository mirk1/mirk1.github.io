<h1>Changes to be made in Future Websites</h1>
<h2><a href="frontpage.html">Back</a></h2>
<p>I would try and include some Javascript(another coding language I have worked with but not proficient in) into my websites</p>
<p>I would try and make website pages more easily accessible rather then having to go back and into another page, back and forth</p>
<p>Add some more images to the site making it lively</p>
<p>Following on with the other coding language, making the site interactive</p>
<p>Change up the scripting to make this website more advanced</p>
<h1>Now the Conclusion...</h1>
<p>Granted of course, I have enjoyed all of this. The process of making this website. As an entry level web developer<br>
 I am very proud of what I have accomplished regardless of its basic origins. I will not consider this as job ready yet however I will<br>
 consider this as a footprint in my journey of life really. I now have other things to attend to, things I have set aside and now realized a 
 mistake. Thank you for your attention and have a good day!!</p>
