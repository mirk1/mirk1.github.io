            <h2>Curiosity | Personal</h2>
            <p>Below is one of my personal projects that I am working on. It is written in Javascript. Now as a computor geek, you must need to have questions in your mind.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the questions can sidetrack you enough times that you won't even work on a project or even touch it. But that is a good thing.</p>
            <div>
            <p>A computer geek must have:
                <ul>
                    <li>Questions</li>
                    <li>A computer..of course :)</li>
                    <li>Some knowledge(Not A lot) of computers</li>
                    <li>A specific interest in the field of computers</li>
                    <li>A good old fashion coding headache :)</li>
                    <li>Most important...an idea(doesn't need to be so oriented and specific)</li>
                    <li>Carelessness towards embrassment</li>
                </ul>
