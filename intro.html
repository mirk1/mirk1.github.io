	    <p id="bob">Origins High School was a good school. Academic wise, should have a little improvement. But oppurtunities was off the charts.
		During my years, I was very confused on what I am going to do after high school. My Mind was changing careers every 
		 5 seconds. So I settled with computors. I became very fond with them and grew into it. Some teachers the school hired were
		    very good choices. Oppurtunities I mentioned before included this because some teacher were also computor novices and I 
		    couldn't grow into the computer field without them so I thank them for everything they done for me. Next is why
		    the website is the way it is.</p>
	    <h1>The reasons why this website is how it is</h1>
	    <p>As the original format of the capstone assignment is to use weebly to present.<br>
		I wrote this to tell you why I did not do such.</p>
    </div>
    <body>
        <p>I coded this website to show you how I grew<br></p>
        <p>I don't like pre-website designers anymore(e.g. weebly, wix, google sites)</p>
		<p>Part of the reason why I took this road is capstone gave me purpose to create a website, benefitting me on my road
	    to become a web developer</p>
		<p>I have found another alternative to suit my needs. A site called Github Pages where you do exactly what I did and upload
		the files you made and done.</p>
