		<p>As the original format of the capstone assignment is to use weebly to present.<br>
		I wrote this to tell you why I did not do such.</p>

        <p>I coded this website to show you how I grew<br></p>
        <p>I don't like pre-website designers anymore(e.g. weebly, wix, google sites)</p>
		<p>Part of the reason why I took this road is the goal of capstone is the practice of me being a web developer</p>
		<p>I have found another alternative to suit my needs. A site called Github Pages where you do exactly what I did and upload
		the files you made and done.</p>
