        <h2>Precision</h2>
        
        <p id="reason">These two projects are from my graphic design elective.<br>
            The reason why I say these are precision is because without precision<br>
            nothing in the images would look coherent.<br> It won't look appealing to my eye<br>
        The first project was more to do with word manipulation and the second to do with image manipulation<br>
        As I was working on these two projects they both had a requirment to fill the entire image. And I would say that the type
        manipulation was the hardest as I forgot how to do it. Image manipulation was towards the beginning of the year and<br>
        most projects in the class dealt with such, thats why I was more capable of manipulating images rather text. But I am a quick 
        learner so it was just trial and error constantly for both projects (for a day or two) and then just took off.</p>
