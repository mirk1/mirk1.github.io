        <h2>Precision</h2>
        <h2>For the image manipulation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>More familiar with this program(PhotoShop)</li>
            <li>More projects were based off of image manipulation</li>
            <li>The shape/size/type of the image(all rectangle bordered) made the project easier to work with</li>
            <li>It was all whether it looks appealing to the eye because of fades applied</li>
            <li>Every image was clear to its place in the outline</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For the type manipulation</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The project consisted of more whether the shape of the letter fitted within the image outline</li>
            <li>Was no longer familiar with the program(Illustrator)</li>
            <li>We had to work individually with the letters</li>
            <li>It wasn't clear to what word its destined place was</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="reason">These two projects are from my graphic design elective.<br>
            The reason why I say these are precision is because without precision<br>
            nothing in the images would look coherent. Which is the growth, the ability to stay persistent, regain skills and make the images
            appealing and coherent at the end
