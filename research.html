            <h2>Research | AP Gov</h2>
            <p id="reason">In this project, we had to research the role of bureaucracys. Not just the role of beauracracies but what is a bureaucracies, the process in passing a public policy and such</p
            <ul>
                <li>The sources used were a lot, we even had to use a book</li>
                <li>The bureaucracy project was confusing so it was tough to find a good and understanding source(but this does not rule out the confusing source)
                    <li>Many topics that we learned previously also applied within the project(Checks and Balances, government branchs) so we had to explain that too</li>
                <li>To the topics that applied also besides bureaucracy, we had to explain specifically(like in government branchs, the houses) what they do during the process of passing a public policy<li>
                <li>We had to explain a process of public policy</li>
                <li>Explanation/Organization</li>
                <p>So the specificity and sources were what made this project different</p>

            <h2>Research | 9th Grade Govern</h2>
            <p> In this project, this is a project done in 9th grade, it isn't the best of them but it showed research, we had to research on the topic of minumum wage and organizations that fight to increase it, and statistics on who is affected by it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sources were straight-forward, nothing was ever confusing</li>
                <li>There wasn't explanation</li>
                <li>There was barely any detail</li>
                <li>A lot of images</li>
                <li>Barely Organized</li>
                <li>A mention of public policy but no specificity, followed a pre-outline</li>
                <p>So this project had no detail, good visuals, but no explanation of it,no specificity and was straightforward</p>
                <li>
